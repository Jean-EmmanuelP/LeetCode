Step of the algorithm:

1. Create an empty stack, st
2. Do following for every character x from left to right
3. If x is:
	- Operand -> Output it
	- Left Parenthesis : Push to st
	- Right Parenthesis : Pop from st until left Parenthesis is found. Output the popped operators.
	- Operator : If st is empty push x to st.
		-> if st is empty, push x to st, else compare with st top.
